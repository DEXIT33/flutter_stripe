# flutter_stripe_sdk

Unofficial Flutter wrapper around Stripe Android and iOS SDKs.

Plugin is in very early stage and only small subset of functionality is implemented. I am working on this as part of my personal application and I will be updating it as I go.

## Getting Started

Project is trying to mimic stripe Android SDK API in Dart. You can start by following the guide here: https://stripe.com/docs/mobile/android/standard

Currently only creation of Ephemeral keys and basic Customer session management are implemented. You can look at example directory for API demonstration

Contributions are welcome!
